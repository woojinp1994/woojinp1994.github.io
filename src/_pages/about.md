<p style="margin: 0"> I'm Woojin.</p>

I have a pretty nice job as a data engineer. On the side, I like to cook extravagant meals for family, friends, and guests. This led me to an adjacent hobby - collecting high end kitchen knives and obsessing over their steel composition, shapes, and fit & finish. In 2023, I took this obsession to a new level - I started forging, grinding, and finishing my own kitchen knives.

## My Experience

TBD

## My Lair

I like to operate out of three primary locations:
    1. My parent-in-law's spare house in Davis, CA
    2. Ace Makerspace in Berkeley, CA
    3. Clay & Steel (Seaport Studios) in Richmond, CA

Where I work out of mainly depends on what I am hoping to learn and improve on at the moment.
